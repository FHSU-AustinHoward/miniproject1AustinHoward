# Mini Project 1

## Description
This project will be using the packages NumPy and Matplotlib in order to create 5 graphs 
that output as PNG files.

This project serves as an introduction to our Advanced Programming with Python class.
The main idea is to pull down selected stocks by their ticker name using yfinance. Then, 
using matplotlib, plot the last 10 trading days of closing prices which are stored in a 
numpy array. This will output into a charts folder and save the graphs as PNG files.

This assignment acts as an introduction to using GitHub, researching API documentation, and 
proper markup of software development.
